I’ve been passionate about programming since I was around 12 years old.
Professionally, I have experience as both a fullstack, devops and backend
software engineer (where I’m most productive). Academically, I’ve worked on
operations research using hybrid exact methods, heuristic optimization, AI, and
bioinformatics (mostly protein structure prediction).

In my free time, I enjoy coding games, experimenting with creative coding, or
exploring anything else that sparks my interest—such as emulators, automated
puzzle solvers, or tools to make my life easier.

Outside of tech, I have many hobbies. I’m a drummer and a painter. I enjoy
hiking, trekking, and camping, and recently started bouldering and climbing as
well. I also practice ceramics and origami, and lately I’ve been getting into
sailing.
