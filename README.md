I am a huge programming fan. I love it since I was 12 years old or so!
Professionally I have experience as a fullstack software engineer and backend
software engineer (this is where I am more productive). Academically I have
worked on operations research using hybrid exact methods, on heuristic
optimization and AI and also with bioinformatics (mostly protein structure
prediction).

On my free time I like to code games, do creative coding, or anything else that
I find interesting, such as emulators, automated puzzle solving or something to
help me with a problem.

Outside of the tech world there are multiple things that I enjoy. I am a drummer
and a painter. I like to go hiking, trekking and camping and rencently I started
bouldering / climbing as well. I also do ceramics, origami, and rencetly I have
been growing into sailing.
